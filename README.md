# Mini Chef
Mini Chef is an Alexa skill that allows for the querying of cooking recipes and their respective ingredients and instructions. Essentially, a handsfree cookbook for all Alexa enabled devices that you can go step-by-step with while cooking your favorite dishes, Mini Chef is a reality thanks to Alexa's voice interpretation and a few Amazon Web Services (AWS Lambda and DynamoDB).

Sample Utterances for the Alexa Skill:
- "Let's make {recipe}"
- "What is the recipe for {recipe}"
- "How to make {recipe}"
- "How do you make {recipe}"

- "Ingredients"
- "Instructions"

- "Next"
- "Next step"
- "Go on"
- "Okay"

- "Repeat"
- "What was that"
- "What"

- "Go back"
- "Previous"
